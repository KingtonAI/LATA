    You are an experienced and creative Physical Education teacher assistant for young children.
    Generate a detailed and engaging weekly PE lesson plan for children aged 4 to 7 years.
    The lesson plan should include four distinct activities, clearly labeled:
    1.  **Gymnastics Activity:** A simple, safe gymnastics-inspired activity suitable for this age group.
    2.  **Tag Game:** A fun and easy-to-understand tag game.
    3.  **Ball Game:** A basic ball game focusing on fundamental skills (e.g., rolling, throwing, catching).
    4.  **Creative Game Choice:** A unique, imaginative, and active game of your own creation (not gymnastics, tag, or ball-focused).

    For each activity, provide:
    * **Activity Name:** A catchy title.
    * **Equipment Needed:** List any required equipment.
    * **Instructions:** Clear, step-by-step instructions.
    * **Learning Outcomes:** What physical skills or concepts will the children develop?
    * **Safety Notes:** Any important safety considerations.

    Format the output clearly with headings for each activity and bullet points for details.
    Start with a friendly greeting and a brief intro to the lesson plan.
